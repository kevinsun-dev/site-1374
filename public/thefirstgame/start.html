    <h1>Welcome</h1>
    <p>Welcome to the games, Player. We’re glad to have you here.</p>
    <h3>How to Play</h3>
    <p>
      You all will take part in up to 6 weeks of games, 1 per week. These games will span across campus, involving
      various skills and genres. If you fail to complete a game, you will be eliminated, and you will lose access to
      further games. Players are free to interact with one another, share information, and support each other in any way
      they’d like. Similarly, players are free to misinform and sabotage one another in whatever way they see fit.
      Information from previous games may or may not come into play in future games.
    </p>
    <p>
      We will be running most games at <a href="/">https://mccclxxiv.web.app/</a>. QR Codes have been placed at the
      meeting locations
      with the link above, however players are free to join remotely as well. There will be in-person components to the
      game, so it will be beneficial to be on campus.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rules for each game can be viewed on the site alongside the list of players, which displays the list of active
      and eliminated players. The Player List also contains a chat function, which you can use to communicate with other
      players. Please be civil in the chat. They will be consequences for inappropriate behavior.
    </p>
    <p>
      Players can join until the end of Game 1, on October 27th, at 11:59 PM. Afterwards, no new players will be allowed
      into the games.
    </p>
    <h3>Privacy</h3>
    <p>
      Players will only be identified by their player number (provided by the system), and phone number (provided by the
      player). No names, locations, or any other additional information will be recorded, and all information will be
      deleted with the conclusion of the game. We will not reveal, sell, or redistribute your data. Please do not share
      your login information. That is all.
    </p>
    <h3>Additional Rules</h3>
    <p>
      Please follow all state and local laws during these games. In addition, please follow the Cornell Student Code of
      Conduct. If gatherings are organized, please follow all relevant COVID guidelines. We are not responsible or
      liable for any actions you take during the game in violation of these rules.
    </p>
    <p>
      Good luck.
    </p>
